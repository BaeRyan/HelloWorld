      What is the actual definition of HTML? HTML actually stands for Hyper Text
      Markup Language or we could call it Web Pages's language. HTML shows us
      the structure in a Web Page and also it considers a series of elements.

      I have chosen to attend the Web Page Design class because I want to be an
      engineer in the future. Currently, I have taken Python, Java, Linux and
      currently taking Web Page Design in your class. I sincerely want to
      improve my knowledge towards computer in order to advance my learning and
      my reputation.
